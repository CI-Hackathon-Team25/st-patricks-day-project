                    <p><strong>Sláinte! Happy Saint Paddy’s day!</strong> Hello, I am Saint Patrick, also known as the “Apostle of Ireland”. I lived a long long time ago, in the fifth century. I was born in Britain and my father was a cavalry officer in the Roman army. I lived an interesting life full of adventure, tragedy and revelation. 
                    My tales and deeds can be found in my autobiography called “Confessio”. When I was sixteen I was captured by a band of Irish pirates and taken from my home in Britain. I was held in captivity for six years forced to work as a shepherd when one day I head a voice that a ship was sailing me to freedom. I fled my masters clutches and made the perilous journey home.
                    Though I was happy to be free, the beauty of Ireland and the kindness of ordinary Irish people never left my heart. 
                    A few years later I had another vision, this time it was of a man called Victoricus. He gave me a letter and in it was written “The voice of the Irish”. It was in this moment that I decided to return to Ireland as a Christian missionary. You may have heard some of the many legends about me. The most famous being that I once chased all the snakes of Ireland into the sea. But alas I have not time to talk now so pour yourself a pint of Guinness and play a quiz to discover more about me!
