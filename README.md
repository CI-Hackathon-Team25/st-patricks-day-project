# Paddy's day greeting

The goal of this project is to remind the history and tradition of Saint Patrick day and at the same make users enjoy with a quiz game. Our goal as Team 25 is to learn how to collaborate as a group in a common project. The aim of this project is also to be contacted by users and developers to have their feedback or the request to develop a game for them.

### Features Left to Implement
- The initial idea was to create a backend website with Django.

## Technologies Used
- This project uses HTML, CSS and Javascript programming languages.
- [BootstrapCDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) to simplify the structure of the website and make the website responsive.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to style the website fonts.
- [AutoPrefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) make sure the css code is valid for all browsers.
- [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/sdk/installation/) to add functionality to our contact form.


## Testing

We tested the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

Our project looks responsive on different browsers and screen sizes.

## Deployment

We deployed the project to a hosting platform (GitHub Pages).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- We used different editors: Gitpod and VS Code.
- We used separated git branches.

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
