# Paddy's day greeting

The goal of this project is to remind the history and tradition of Saint Patrick day and at the same make users enjoy with a quiz game. Our goal as Team 25 is to learn how to collaborate as a group in a common project. The aim of this project is also to be contacted by users and developers to have their feedback or the request to develop a game for them.

* An English or Gaelic speaking person.

The greeting generator allows users to leave their greet and at the same time to read the greetings of their friends. 
The quiz game allows the users to challenge themselves and provides them a final score.
The info section describes us as a Team and a contact form allows users to get in touch with us.

### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- The initial idea was to create a backend website with Django.

## Technologies Used
- This project uses HTML, CSS and Javascript programming languages.
- [BootstrapCDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) to simplify the structure of the website and make the website responsive.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to style the website fonts.
- [AutoPrefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) make sure the css code is valid for all browsers.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
